This program was made to minimise errors from students at measurements.
The interface of the program is very simple. It consists from two widgets, which will display plots of signals and spectres, buttons to manipulate oscilloscope and functions.
1) Button "START" account for strarting the osciloscope`s generator. Before strating generating, you can choose the frequency of the signal in spinBox and the form of signal in combobox.
The frequency should be between 1kHz and 20MHz. 
2) Button "BLOCK" account for collecting data from both channels. It gets 1024 points of signal and plot voltage versus time. The blue line requires for A channel, red -- B channel.
3) Button "START FFT" makes a fouire transform form input signal and plots voltage versus frequency.
